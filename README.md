# Waste Classifier (Transfer Learning + Fine Tuning)

A deep learning project that classifies waste products into categories using **Transfer Learning (TL)** and **Fine Tuning (FT)**.  
The model leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in waste classification, helping automate sustainable waste management.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Image classification of waste into recyclable / non-recyclable categories.
- Implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained CNN backbones.
- Fine-tuned layers for improved accuracy.
- Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step workflow.

## 📊 Workflow
1. Load dataset and preprocess images.  
2. Apply transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet).  
3. Fine-tune model layers for better feature extraction.  
4. Train and evaluate model performance.  
5. Save trained model for deployment.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Uttam1611/waste-classifier-tl-ft.git
cd waste-classifier-tl-ft
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment & install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `waste_classifier.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

---

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~XX% (replace with your final results)  
- Loss curves and confusion matrix available in `results/`.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Deploy model as a **REST API** (FastAPI/Flask).  
- Build a **web app** or **mobile app** for real-time classification.  
- Expand dataset to include more waste categories.
